# MJS-Portfolio

## Description

For this project I built and styled a webpage which showcases my work, who I am, and how to get in touch with me. The criteria for this projected was:

    C1. Deployed webpage has my name, updated photo/avatar (with alt attributes), and functional navigation links (About Me, Work/Projects, Contact Me)
    C2. First application/project should be the largest image  
    C3. When clicked, images should deploy application
    C4. Application should be viewable on various screen sizes and devices

Having deployed projects is considered the minimum requirement to become a Developer. By creating a portfolio, I am able to have a space which organizes and showcases these projects. These projects demonstrate my skills, talents, and dedication to producing quailty work.
